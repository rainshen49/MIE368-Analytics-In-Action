I work a lot, so I had a hard time finding the time to book an appointment as most salons are closed on Sundays (the ONE DAY I end work early or don't work at all). As if God himself was sending me a message, I ran into a co-worker of mine who had her brows done by Anna Victoria. They looked VERY natural and I was excited to know that someone I knew was also into microbladed eyebrow tattoos. I went through Anna Victoria's Instagram account (@annavictoriachow) and decided that I was ready to book my appointment. I booked it a month in advance (I know my schedule months in advance) for Easter Sunday (I know, I'm horrible), the ONLY Sunday I was available.

Anna called me the morning of, letting me know she was running 15mins behind. Totally fine, not a problem, especially because she called me 30mins prior to my appointment time (I hadn't left home yet). When I got to the salon, Anna was SUPER friendly and welcoming, offering me coffee and timbits. We chatted for a while, just getting to know each other better. 

Soon after we headed into a room for the consultation and procedure. I didn't have anything specific in mind for my brows. My only request was that they be natural (especially because I don't wear make up all the time). She knew exactly what I wanted and understood my concerns. She then measured and outlined the desired shape, always asking if I was happy with what she was suggesting. This process took about an hour to an hour and a half. I appreciated that she was very patient. 

Next step was to pick colours and start the microblading. I brought her my Anastasia Dip Brow in Medium Brown as a reference, as that is the colour I use to fill in my brows on a daily basis. 

HERE WE GO WITH THE ACTUAL MICROBLADING! Anna was great with the anesthetic, making sure my brows were completely numb before the process. The procedure was painless, except for some areas the numbing cream did not affect (high points in the brow, ends of the brow) (due to no fault of Anna's). It was a little uncomfortable lying down on the table for so long, but of course that can't be helped. I was super happy when the procedure was 90% over - I was able to get up and stretch a bit. SHE WAS EXTREMELY THOROUGH DURING THE PROCEDURE!

THIS REVIEW IS LONG. But overall I am EXTREMELY happy with the results. I didn't know what to expect going in, but I am happy with the results that I got. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing Anna Victoria if you're looking into microblading, ESPECIALLY if you live in the Markham/Richmond Hill/Vaughan area - it's great that there is a talented technician close to home!",2016-03-28T17:18:07,The Good Geisha,576 Dundas Street W,Toronto,ON,M5T 1H5,43.6526154,-79.4005169,4.5,6,True,"Cosmetics & Beauty Supply, Shopping, Eyelash Service, Tattoo, Permanent Makeup, Beauty & Spas, Skin Care",Melanie,12,2015-06-10T00:58:00,21,5,2,0,3.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
