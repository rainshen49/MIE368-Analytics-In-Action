I work a lot, so I had a hard time finding the time to book an appointment as most salons are closed on Sundays (the ONE DAY I end work early or don't work at all). As if God himself was sending me a message, I ran into a co-worker of mine who had her brows done by Anna Victoria. They looked VERY natural and I was excited to know that someone I knew was also into microbladed eyebrow tattoos. I went through Anna Victoria's Instagram account (@annavictoriachow) and decided that I was ready to book my appointment. I booked it a month in advance (I know my schedule months in advance) for Easter Sunday (I know, I'm horrible), the ONLY Sunday I was available.

Anna called me the morning of, letting me know she was running 15mins behind. Totally fine, not a problem, especially because she called me 30mins prior to my appointment time (I hadn't left home yet). When I got to the salon, Anna was SUPER friendly and welcoming, offering me coffee and timbits. We chatted for a while, just getting to know each other better. 

Soon after we headed into a room for the consultation and procedure. I didn't have anything specific in mind for my brows. My only request was that they be natural (especially because I don't wear make up all the time). She knew exactly what I wanted and understood my concerns. She then measured and outlined the desired shape, always asking if I was happy with what she was suggesting. This process took about an hour to an hour and a half. I appreciated that she was very patient. 

Next step was to pick colours and start the microblading. I brought her my Anastasia Dip Brow in Medium Brown as a reference, as that is the colour I use to fill in my brows on a daily basis. 

HERE WE GO WITH THE ACTUAL MICROBLADING! Anna was great with the anesthetic, making sure my brows were completely numb before the process. The procedure was painless, except for some areas the numbing cream did not affect (high points in the brow, ends of the brow) (due to no fault of Anna's). It was a little uncomfortable lying down on the table for so long, but of course that can't be helped. I was super happy when the procedure was 90% over - I was able to get up and stretch a bit. SHE WAS EXTREMELY THOROUGH DURING THE PROCEDURE!

THIS REVIEW IS LONG. But overall I am EXTREMELY happy with the results. I didn't know what to expect going in, but I am happy with the results that I got. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing Anna Victoria if you're looking into microblading, ESPECIALLY if you live in the Markham/Richmond Hill/Vaughan area - it's great that there is a talented technician close to home!",2016-03-28 17:18:07,The Good Geisha,576 Dundas Street W,Toronto,ON,M5T 1H5,43.6526154,-79.4005169,4.5,6,t,"Cosmetics & Beauty Supply, Shopping, Eyelash Service, Tattoo, Permanent Makeup, Beauty & Spas, Skin Care",Melanie,12,2015-06-10 00:58:00,21,5,2,0,3.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The brewery has a very large dining hall, but we took seats in the bar. Our barmaid was very lovely, knowledgeable and entertained our requests for samples. I finally settled for the Outrageous Fortune, which included chenin blanc grapes in its fermentation? Production? Overall, I found the taste too sour. After tasting different samples at the beer fest, this one didn't have a great taste.

So last week, on a day off, I came here for breakfast. Not a weekend because this restaurant has lineups over 45 min of wait time! 

I arrived before 11am and sat down for the baked French toast I have been dreaming of. The dish arrived with 2 small toast deeply covered in powdered sugar, maple syrup on the side, and a generous portion of berries, grapes, 1 watermelon piece and cantaloupe melon. The cantaloupe was not ripe by the way.

I admit, I was discombobulated by the actual French toast. Unlike cheaper diners, or even other restaurants that serve brunch on the weekends, these were smaller portions. And unlike those other servings, this left me satiated without the bloat. In the end, I reconciled the image in my mind with what was actually served.

I headed to the cashier to settle my bill. I don't understand why they don't accept cash. Allegedly, they have ""many transactions under $4"". Somehow, I have a very difficult time accepting that argument because at the very least, in one sitting during the entire day, they can collect up to $180 (they have 12 tables of 2 and using an average of $15 bill). In one sitting. There are many, many more sittings and on an average month of 26 days (they don't open on Mondays), you can do the month of how much they can earn. What is missing from my equation is the understanding of their fixed costs and variable costs, and the negotiations that occur with trusted suppliers. I wish I could have had a conversation with the manager to understand better why they don't use a POS terminal.

I arrived early to meet my party. There was only one reservation under the person's name. I was seated down. I waited for 20 minutes and no one came to check on me. While I was waiting, because I was concerned that maybe I was in the wrong spot - I was seated far away from the main dining room, I asked a manager. He checked and said there was no problem.

This didn't sit well with me and I contacted the meetup group inquiring if it had been canceled. I found out they were all seated in a separate table!

When I told the manager this situation, he didn't express any emotion. I was not even escorted to the table. I went to the table because the meetup organizer met me. To my chagrin, they had already ordered. I hated sitting & waiting for 20 min only to later discovered the entire party was seated together and had ordered!

I lost appetite and nothing on the menu seemed appealing. I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and it was a basic dish.

The emotionless manager saw me as we were settling our individual bills and remarked how I found my group. I explained what happened and told him the hostess made a mistake. She sat me under the reservation but then didn't honour the reservation and seated the others in a different table. He argued with me and told me she did her job and that another member of the party didn't recognize me and so they sat us separately. I told him it was a meetup group and there was a reservation under ""_"". He disregarded that and blamed the other meetup member for not knowing me. It's a meetup group and people don't know each other.

The hostess didn't seat the person in the table under the reservation. She took her elsewhere. And the manager refused to apologize or even express empathy. Instead, he blamed the other meetup person for not recognizing me and ergo it's not their responsibility. It was our fault. The paying customer's fault.

When you enter, the tall ceilings helps create the illusion this place is enormous! Well, the lobby area where you check in for your class on the tablet, also includes a welcome desk to the left. To the right, they have arranged branded exercise gear for sale.

You are given a locker, a shiny water bottle, shoes. You just have to book online and show up!

The bathrooms, filled with several essential toiletries, are large and clean. There are showers too, but I have not used them yet.

I then returned to redeem a FREE b-day class! The help from the staff was just as a superb as on that first day! I signed up for Wine Down Weds and to my surprise, we were greeted with a small glass of wine after class!

There are several pricing options, with the generic $99 unlimited 1st month introductory rate.

The instructors are full of life and positive. No drill sergeants antics. The studio is enormous, and with the dimmed lights during the class and music, it feels more like a club than a gym! And like a great club with your music set, you sweat it out, get a rise in your heartbeat, exercised your arms, and leave invigorated, not exhausted.

The Old Master's collection includes Rembrandt, baroque, and impressionists. The Thomson Collection's Group of Seven is a quiet meditation into Canadian landscapes and winter sceneries. I enjoy the Contemporary Canadian exhibits because I get to take a peak into parts of Canadian history I would otherwise not know.

But what keeps bringing me back are the traveling exhibitions: Georgia O'Keefe, David Bowie, Monet/Van Gogh, Lawren Harris, Toronto Tributes and Tributaries, etc. The curators do a fine job of weaving the influence and impact of the artists. You leave with a greater appreciation of culture. In the day to day of your life.
